            <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and
                investor best known for co-founding the technology company Apple Inc. Jobs was also the founder of NeXT
                and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of
                the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

                Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972
                before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before
                later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell
                Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with
                production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
